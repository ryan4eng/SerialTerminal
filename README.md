**Serial Terminal**

This application was developed to aid in emebdded working. Especially with AT command based targets that require many text boxes - hence the large quantity.

Many people may realise this looks and operates quite similar to the Hercules serial and full credit goes to that team for giving me the creativity (or lack there of) to develop this appication.

This app has its histories, but is currently targeted for Visual Studio 2019 .NET framework V4.8 on WinForms.

When originally making this application, the WinForm programality made the most sense to me coming initially from a C/++ background. As such there have been no intentions and highly unlikely to move to more mordern xaml (or smiilar) platforms.



Keen for people to use, distribute etc. While I have worked on this from scratch on and off as some aspects were needed like logging to a file automatically, or added time stamps to serial commands. Its a huge tech debt that just works for me at this stage!

Some bugs still exist and will likely get fixed as I find them and I can be bothered working on them!

Enjoy the application and I hope it works well for you too.
