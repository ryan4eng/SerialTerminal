------------TODO---------------

- Change font and make larger
- Add log file capability
- Right click on ct100i and Program GSM buttons to bring up menu with open file location

------------Bugs---------------
- Control+F(key) still doesn't work
- when I minimise the app and reopen it doesn't go back fullscreen
- cursor doesn't go to the end of the application when I append text
